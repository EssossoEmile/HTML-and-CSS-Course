## JavaScript Project Descriptions

## Project2_functions  
A foundational project focused on JavaScript functions, covering declaration, parameter handling, and return values. Demonstrated use of modular code for improved readability and reusability.

## Project3_math_operators  
Explored basic and advanced mathematical operations in JavaScript. Covered arithmetic operations, order of precedence, and real-world use cases in calculation logic.

## Project4_dictionaries  
Built JavaScript objects (dictionaries) to store and retrieve key-value pairs. Practiced data structuring, access patterns, and dynamic property manipulation.

## Project5_comparisons_type_coercion  
Focused on equality and relational comparisons. Investigated type coercion in JavaScript (`==` vs `===`) and how JavaScript handles different data types during comparisons.

## Project6_ternary__operators_constructors  
Used ternary operators for concise conditional expressions and built object constructors to model reusable object blueprints in JavaScript.

## Project7_scope_time_function  
Explored function scope, local vs global variables, and the concept of time-based functions like `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` in asynchronous operations.

## Project8_string_methods  
Practiced using built-in string methods like `.toUpperCase()`, `.substring()`, `.replace()`, and `.split()` to manipulate and analyze text data in JavaScript.

## Project9_countdown_slideshow  
Created a functional countdown timer combined with a basic slideshow. Integrated DOM manipulation and timing functions to update content dynamically.

## Project10_loops_arrays  
Utilized various loop structures (`for`, `while`, `forEach`) to iterate through arrays. Applied array methods like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.splice()` to handle collections efficiently.
